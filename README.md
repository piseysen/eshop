ESHOP is a project for a student assignment.

## Django Setup

To set up Django for your project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Django using pip, which is the package installer for Python. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

    This will install the latest version of Django.

3. Create a new Django project by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    django-admin startproject project_name
    ```

    Replace `project_name` with the desired name for your project.

4. Change into the project directory by running the following command:

    ```bash
    cd project_name
    ```

5. Run the development server to verify that your Django installation is working correctly:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    This will start the development server on `http://localhost:8000/`. You should see a "Congratulations!" message in your browser.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Django for your project.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Django set up, you can start building your web application. Refer to the Django documentation for more information on how to get started: https://docs.djangoproject.com/

Happy coding!
